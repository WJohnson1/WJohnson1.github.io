		My name is William Johnson. I am currently a senior in highschool from New Jersey. I am a student programmer. I want to be an engineer and learning coding languages and their practical applictions in the world is an invaluable skill. This is why I was drawn towards ASC because this program is an oppurtunity that simply cannot be missed.

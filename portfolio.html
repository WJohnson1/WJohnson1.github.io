			I have worked on several projects during my time at ASC. My most work-induced projects were Space Invaders and Battleship. My Space Invaders project isn't completed but the Battleship project runs successfully. I also worked on several other projects including designing a Car, making a paint tool, a Jackson Pollok Painting and a design for Tetris. I also made an incomplete version of Pong. My final project with ASC was a Rio Olympics based minigame website. I created the swimming, diving, and rubgy games. The links below will show you the code for each project. This has been a terrific experience. I had so much fun at ASC and I can't to see what we will do next.
